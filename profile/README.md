👋 [**`AivenIO`**](https://github.com/aivenio) is a scalable database platform built for modern data services - fully managed,
cloud-native, and highly adaptable to your specific requirements. The usage is infinite - from a collection of awesome data for
projects or integration with applications that provide data-driven (backed) decision-making for a holistic picture in the fields
of (but not limited to) science and technology, finance, and macroeconomic factors.

## ✨ Getting Started

The repository provides PostgreSQL as the de facto backend database, divided into *microservices* that can work independently or
in coordination with other projects. The different microservices can either be configured in separate servers (clouds, systems)
or can be configured in the same host under a different named schema. Check our [website](https://aivenio.github.io/) or our
community discussion [page](https://github.com/orgs/aivenio/discussions) for more details. Check the individual project's updated
release from the badges.
